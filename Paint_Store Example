CREATE TABLE 'paint_store' (id integer PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, rank INTEGER, price INTEGER, sheen TEXT);
Previous line is based on my knowledge of paint and what I think the paint products should be ranked as with pricing.

Previous sets from lines 4 to 19 contain information that goes into the paint_store table. The table contains the primary key id, as well as the name of the paint 
product, where it ranks to me personally, the price of the product and the sheen. 

SELECT * FROM 'paint_store';
SELECT *FROM 'paint_store' ORDER BY price desc;
SELECT name FROM 'paint_store' ORDER by price desc;
Lines 23 to 26 were used to choose specific parts of the data set instead of the whole thing like was done with the line 23 command.
